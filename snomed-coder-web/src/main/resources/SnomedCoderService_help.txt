## Web service end points

### /snomed-coder-web/rest/v1.0/snomedctCodes

This is a web service to analyse English clinical text and return all the SNOMED CT concepts that could be found. The service can return JSON or XML. By default JSON is returned, but by passing the HTTP `Accept` header you can determine what you want to have returned:

    Accept: application/json

    Accept: text/xml



#### The simple case

To use the web service simply POST some URL encoded text (with the content type `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`)
to this URL, which will return a JSON response. If you are on Linux or OSX a simple test might look like this (note the `python` line is optional and only used to make it more human readable):

    curl -s --request POST \
        -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
        --data-urlencode "The patient had a stroke." \
        http://snomedct.t3as.org/snomed-coder-web/rest/v1.0/snomedctCodes \
        | python -mjson.tool

To get the answer as XML, pass a suitable `Accept` header (note the `xmllint` line is optional and only used to make it more human readable):

    curl -s --request POST \
        -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
        -H "Accept: text/xml" \
        --data-urlencode "The patient had a stroke." \
        http://snomedct.t3as.org/snomed-coder-web/rest/v1.0/snomedctCodes \
        | xmllint --format -



#### Specifying custom MetaMap Semantic Types

It is also possible to specify custom Semantic Types for MetaMap, which can be used to filter the categories of concepts that are searched for. To do this you can use the `semanticType` web service documented in the section below, alternatively see this web page which has the current available semantic types:

<http://metamap.nlm.nih.gov/Docs/SemanticTypes_2013AA.txt>

Once you have determined which semantic types to use you can then pass a JSON request containing the text to analyse and the types:

    {
        "options": [
            "restrict_to_sts fndg,dsyn,ftcn"
        ],
        "text": "The patient had a stroke."
    }

When using the web service in this way you must set the `Content-Type` header to JSON:

    curl -s --request POST \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        --data '{"text": "The patient had a stroke.", "options": ["restrict_to_sts fndg,dsyn,ftcn"]}' \
        http://snomedct.t3as.org/snomed-coder-web/rest/v1.0/snomedctCodes \
        | python -mjson.tool

Note that if you do not pass any semantic types the analysis will be done with all types. An alternative is that you can also pass the special value '[all]', without the single quotes, to run an analysis using all types.



#### Specifying MetaMap sources

It is now possible to specify which sources that you want MetaMap to search for concepts in - meaning that the service is no longer restricted to SNOMED CT only. To specify which sources you are interested in use the `restrict_to_sources` option (see more on how to set options in a section below):
 
    "restrict_to_sources SNOMEDCT_US,RXNORM"

If you do not set the `restrict_to_sources` option then the web service will automatically set it to `SNOMEDCT_US`. If you would prefer to use the MetaMap default sources then pass the value `[default]`:

    "restrict_to_sources [default]"



#### Specifying MetaMap options

It is possible to pass specific runtime options for MetaMap. To do this include `options` in a JSON request:

    {
        "options": [
            "ignore_word_order",
            "composite_phrases 8"
        ],
        "text": "The patient had a stroke.",
    }

Use something like the following for a command line test:

    curl -s --request POST \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        --data '{"text": "The patient had a stroke.", "options": ["ignore_word_order","composite_phrases 8"]}' \
        http://snomedct.t3as.org/snomed-coder-web/rest/v1.0/snomedctCodes \
        | python -mjson.tool

MetaMap is always run with these minimum options:

    composite_phrases=4
    lexicon=db
    lexicon_year=2013
    mm_data_year=2013AB
    XMLf1

The following additional MetaMap options are supported:

    all_acros_abbrs
    allow_large_n
    composite_phrases 8
    ignore_stop_phrases
    ignore_word_order
    no_derivational_variants
    restrict_to_sources SNOMEDCT_US
    strict_model
    word_sense_disambiguation

Adding more options is relatively trivial (and can be done on request), but does require code changes.



### /snomed-coder-web/rest/v1.0/semanticTypes

Behind the scenes NLM MetaMap is used, and it is possible to specify which MetaMap Semantic Types (STs) that we are
interested in. In order to do so it can be handy to first get a list of the STs that are available, which will also
indicate if it is a type that is enabled by default by the web service if no STs are specifically passed:

    curl -s http://snomedct.t3as.org/snomed-coder-web/rest/v1.0/semanticTypes | python -mjson.tool
