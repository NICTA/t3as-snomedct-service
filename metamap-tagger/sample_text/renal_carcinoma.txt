The patient is a 75 year old female with history of previous stroke, hypertension, stable COPD, and renal carcinoma, presenting after a fall and possible syncope.

While walking, she accidentally fell to her knees and did hit her head on the ground, near her left eye.  Her fall was not observed, but the patient does not profess any loss of consciousness, recalling the entire event.

The patient does have a history of previous falls, one of which resulted in a hip fracture. She has had physical therapy and recovered completely from that.

Initial examination showed bruising around the left eye, normal lung examination, normal heart examination, normal neurologic function with a baseline decreased mobility of her left arm.

The patient was admitted for evaluation of her fall and to rule out syncope and possible stroke with her positive histories.
